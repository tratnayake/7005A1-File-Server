	- send file transfer command ("SEND,filename")

	- wait for response message from server that contains new port number to initiate a new connection on

	- read response message

	- Grab new port

	- make new socket and connect to server on new port

	- grab a file, break it down into bits and push over sockets output stream

	- close the socket

SERVER 

Make a new socket on 7005 and listen for connections

When you accept connection, the first data to come through will be a COMMAND (either a SEND|GET,FILENAME)

SWITCH on COMMAND 

SEND (Client's SEND) = do GET (go into receive mode)

GET (Client's GET) = do SEND ( go into file send mode)


GET:

Create a new socket that will serve the file transfer only ( a second channel )

Send a response to client with the new sockets port.

Listen for connections on the new socket

Accept connection,

Accept all data on inputstream as bits, then build up into file.

Close connection.
